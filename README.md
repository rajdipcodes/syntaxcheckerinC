# syntaxcheckerinC
The main goal of this project was to create a Syntax Checker C program that would read another .cpp file and its respective source code line by line to bring out some basic information, functions used, variables used, and errors in brackets. Though while executing a program the errors are shown, but this project can work as a compact information sheet of another long code. This can help the programmer to find out errors and whoever is working on the code can easily understand the basics and functionality of it.
